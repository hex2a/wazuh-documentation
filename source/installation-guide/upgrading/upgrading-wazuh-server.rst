Upgrading Wazuh server
=====================================

This section will update your current Wazuh 1.1 installation to Wazuh 2.0. Following the next guide, your current installation will be automatically update:

#. First of all, stop eveything:

	::

			/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control stop
			systemctl stop wazuh-api

#. If you have a distributed architecture, remove logstash-forwarder:

	    Deb systems::

	    	apt-get remove logstash-forwarder

	    RPM systems::

	    	yum remove logstash-forwarder

#. Install Wazuh server:

		- :ref:`Install Wazuh server with RPM packages <wazuh_server_rpm>`
		- :ref:`Install Wazuh server with Deb packages <wazuh_server_deb>`

#. Run ``/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents -V`` to check that everything worked as expected::

	root@bb8:/home/leia# /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents -V

	Wazuh v2.0 - Wazuh Inc.

#. Once everything is updated, review your ``ossec.conf``. The configuration file **/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf will be overwritten**. The *old* configuration file from the current installation is saved as *ossec.conf.rpmorig* or *ossec.conf.deborig*. You should compare the new file with the old one.

	Also, a backup of your previous ruleset will be saved at */var/ossec/etc/backup_ruleset*. You need to review it in case you have created new rules/decoders in other file than *local_rules.xml* or *local_decoder.xml*.

.. note::
	**Next upgrades (versions > 2.0) will not overwrite the file /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf**. In these cases, the *new* configuration file from the update package is installed as *ossec.conf.rpmnew* or *ossec.conf.debnew* and might reflect new options or a new notion of best practices.
